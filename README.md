Our group originally decided to work together on each element of the application.  We started with putting together a wireframe and listing out objectives on a trello board.
After that we made a skeleton in VSCode. While working together through the application, we realized that we would need to find a new approach to successfully complete the 
objectives on time. We assigned specific tasks and committed a time to check in with eachother to debug and ask questions. Our biggest takeaway is in the early stages of the 
project to clearly identify details of the objectives and assign roles and times to re-group. This will be our Approach with the Blue Badge Group Project.
